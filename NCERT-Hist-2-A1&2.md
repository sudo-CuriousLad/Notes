## Q1: Imagine that you are a striking worker in 1905 who is being tried in court for your act of rebellion. Draft the speech you would make in your defence. Act out your speech in class.

I have done nothing wrong. We workers have striked in response to our conditions and demand better conditions. You would have done so if put in the same conditions! We have been exploited over and over again, just so that the rich get richer, and we are left in poverty. Our livelihood is also being destroyed, with these ridiculous prices which keep increase, and a subsequently decreasing wage. At this rate, us workers will die, and as always, the nobility will exploit those who come after us, and this cycle will continue. Is it too much to ask for a reasonable life? Is it too much to ask for reasonable wages, reasonable working hours, reasonable working conditions? When we try to protest, we are killed. A prime example being the Bloody Sunday.

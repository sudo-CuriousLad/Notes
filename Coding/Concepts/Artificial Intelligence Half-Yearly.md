#### Twitter
AI is used by Twitter for fraud detection, removing propaganda, and hateful content. Twitter also uses AI to recommend tweets that users might enjoy, based on what type of tweets they engage with.

# WHY IS LEARNING ABOUT AI IMPORTANT?
AI is all around us, people use artificial intelligence every single day. This is already true of many professions today.
- Doctors use AI to diagnose patients based on medical scans, like X-rays. 
- Astronauts can use AI models to detect exoplanets, or planets outside our Solar System. 

# LEARNING AI 
## Teachable Machine
Teachable Machine is a fast and easy way to create machine learning models (without any coding involved). Train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses.
## Quick Draw
This is a game built with machine learning. It is an online game developed by Google that challenges players to draw a picture of an object and then uses a neural network artificial intelligence to guess what the drawings represent.
## Scratch
It is one of our favorites, user-friendly and a great programming tool.

# LEVELS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
## Artificial Narrow Intelligence (Weak AI)
Artificial Narrow Intelligence is goal-oriented and is designed to perform singular tasks. Although these machines are seen to be intelligent, they function under minimal limitations, and thus, are referred to as weak AI. It does not mimic human intelligence, it stimulates human behavior based on certain parameters.

### Examples of weak or narrow AI are:
- Siri, Alexa, Cortana
- IBM Watson
- Self-driving cars
- Facial recognition software
- Email spam filters
- Prediction tools 

## Artificial General Intelligence (Strong AI or Deep AI)
Artificial General Intelligence refers to the concept through which machines can mimic human intelligence while showcasing the ability to apply their intelligence to solve problems. Scientists have not been able to achieve this level of intelligence yet. Scientists would have to find a way through which machines can become conscious through programming a set of cognitive abilities.
A few properties of deep AI are- 
- Recognition 
- Recall 
- Hypothesis testing 
- Imagination 
- Analogy 
- Implication 
## Artificial Super-intelligence 
Currently, super-intelligence is just a hypothetical concept. People assume that it may be possible to develop such artificial intelligence in the future, but it doesn’t exist in the current world. Super-intelligence can be known as that level wherein the machine surpasses human capabilities and becomes self-aware.

This concept has been the muse to several films, and science fiction novels, wherein robots who are capable of developing their feelings and emotions can overrun humanity itself. The concept of artificial superintelligence is still unknown to us, its consequences can’t be guessed, and its impact cannot be measured just yet. 
# GOALS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
The overall goal would be to allow machines and computers to learn and function intelligently. Some of the other goals of AI are as follows:
- **Problem-solving**: Researchers developed algorithms that were able to imitate the step-by-step process that humans use while solving a puzzle. The search for efficient problem-solving algorithms is one of the goals of artificial intelligence. 
- **Knowledge representation**: Machines are expected to solve problems that require extensive knowledge. Artificial intelligence represents objects, properties, events, cause and effect, and much more. 
- **Planning**: One of the goals of AI should be to set intelligent goals and achieve them. Being able to make predictions about how actions will impact change, and what are the choices available. 
- **Learning**: One of the fundamental concepts of AI, machine learning, is the study of computer algorithms that continue to improve over time through experience.
- **Social Intelligence**: Affective computing is essentially the study of systems that can interpret, recognize, and process human efforts. It is a confluence of computer science, psychology, and cognitive science.

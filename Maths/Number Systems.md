## **Rational Numbers**
A number which can be written in the form:
$${p \over q}\ |\ q \neq 0 $$

# Properties
### Commutative Law
* Addition $\implies a + b = b + a$
* Multiplication $\implies a \times b = b \times a$

### Associative Law
* Addition $\implies (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
* Multiplication $\implies (a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$

### Law of distribution
$$a \times (b + c) = ab + ac \ (Addition\ over\ Multiplication)$$
* Identity element of Addition = $0$
* Identity element of Multiplication = $1$
* Additive inverse of $a = -a$
* Multiplicative inverse of $a = {1 \over a}$

## **Irrational Numbers**
* Numbers which cannot be expressed in the form:$${p \over q}\ |\ q \neq 0 $$
* They are non-recurring and non-terminating in a decimal form.

title: Note!
Between two rational numbers, an infinite number of rational numbers exist.

## **Real Numbers**
* If $x$ and $y$ are two real numbers, then:
```math
%34o$$%34c
||{"id":715879475076}||

(i)\ n > y
(ii)\ n < y
(iii)\ n = y
%34o$$%34c
```
#### Absolute value
The absolute value of a real number is:
$$|x| = \left\{ {\begin{align} x \ \ if\ \ x\ \geq 0 \\ -x\ if\ x\ < 0\end{align}}\right\}$$
#### For example:
$$\begin{aligned} |-1| = -(-&1) = 1 \\ \\  |4| = 4\end{aligned}$$
## **Surds**
For any rational number a, which cannot be represented as $\sqrt[n]{a}$, then the irrational number $\sqrt[n]{a}$ or $a^{1 \over n}$ $\to$ **surds**.

Eg $\to$ $\sqrt{7}, \sqrt{8}, \sqrt[4]{27}, \sqrt[9]{2}$

# Limits
Limits are a very ***integral*** part of calculus. \*ba dump tss\* They are used to express the fact that an infinite number of steps can give a finite result, known as the **limit**

for example: $$\begin{align} 2 = { 1 + \frac12 + \frac14 + \frac18 + \frac1{16} + \frac1{32} + \frac1{64} + \dots} \end{align}$$
so:
$$\begin{align} 1.5 = 1  + \frac1{2} \\\\
1.75 = 1  + \frac1{2} +& \frac14 \\
1.875 = 1  + \frac1{2} +& \frac14 + \frac18 \\
\vdots \\
2
\end{align}$$

This solves Zeno's Dichotomy, since adding an infinite number of segments can result to a definite length and time.

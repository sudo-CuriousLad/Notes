# Lines and Angles
## Properties of lines and points
- Two distinct points in a plane determine a unique line.
- Two distinct lines can't have more than 1 common point.
- When there is a line and a point (not on the line), there is only one unique line which passes throught the point that is parallel to the line.

## Angles
Formed by two rays with a common initial point.

### Types of angles

- 180° or straight line
- 90° or right angle
- >90° or obtuse angle
- <90° or acute angle

### Angle Relations
##### Adjacent Angles
* Have the same vertex
* Have a common ray

##### Linear Pairs
When two or more adjacent angles have a sum of 180° or make a straight line when joined are known as a linear pair.

##### Parallel Lines
Lines that will never intersect each other. The angle between them is 0°.

##### Traversal
A line which intersects a pair of parallel lines.

# Triangle and it's angles
## Nature
* No equal side or angle $\implies$ Scalene
* 2 equal sides & angles $\implies$ Isoceles
* All sides are equal and angle measure is 60° $\implies$ Equilateral
* All sides are acute $\implies$ Acute-angled
* All sides are obtuse $\implies$ Obtuse-angled

## Properties
* Sum of all angles is 180°.
* Sum of all adjacent angles is equal to the exterior angle of the third angle.
* $(O)$ Center $\implies$ meeting point of altitudes.
* $(C)$ Circumcenter $\implies$ meeting point of perpendicular bisectors.
* $(G)$ Centroids $\implies$ meeting point of bisectors.
* $OG : GC ::  2 : 1 (They\ are\ colinear)$ 

# Polygons
* Sum of all interior angles with $n$ sides
$$((n - 2 ) \times 180)°$$
* Measure of each angle
$$(\frac{(n-2) \times 180}{n})°$$
* Sum of exterior angles of every polygon is 360°.
